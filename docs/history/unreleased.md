<summary><strong>Development and docs</strong></summary>

- About lists mozilla-firefox/firefox under **Engineering & CI**, as a
  reference for agent guidance that loads area docs only when relevant, tool and
  verification pitfalls recorded in the repository, and the AI-assisted
  contribution policy.
- The agent guide keeps a short always-read core and maps each area to the
  docs to read before changing it. It also forbids invented issue numbers,
  versions, migration numbers, release tags, and catalog codes, and requires
  the user's approval before pushing, opening or updating a pull request, or
  posting on issues, discussions, or reviews.
- Testing docs list local pitfalls: Playwright reusing a server already on
  port 3100, `npm ci` in frontend make targets beside a running Vite server,
  `npx` without `node_modules`, line endings for Prettier and `gofmt` in a
  CRLF checkout, the hard-coded UI copy and sensitive-key checks, e2e specs
  that locate elements by UI copy, and argument binding in multi-statement
  SQLite `Exec` calls.
- Agent skills in `.claude/skills/` cover release preparation, GitHub issue
  reply drafts, and doc translation sync, with an admission rule that keeps
  only repository-wide workflows.
- Contributing describes the AI-assisted contribution policy.
